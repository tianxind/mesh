CS 348a Homework 3:  Principal Curvatures and Directions
------------------------------------------------------------

In this homework, you will compute principal curvatures and directions on triangle meshes using the algorithm described in Taubin's "Estimating the Tensor of Curvature of a Surface from a Polyhedral Approximation."

There are three slots in need of your code, which are marked clearly.  Two are in renderMesh() in src/main.cpp and the third is in src/curvature.cpp.

This "skeleton code" is designed to compile on the Myth machines.  To do so, simply type "make" at the command line.  Then, to run the viewer, type:

	./drawMesh models/horse.off 
	
at the command line, where models/horse.off is the model you wish to use.

The easiest way to get started is to write your code on a Myth machine, either in person or via SSH with X forwarding.  If you prefer to work on your personal machine, you will need to modify makefile.in to point to the proper libraries.  The CAs can help you get started.
